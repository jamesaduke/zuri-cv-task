            <h1>James Aduke</h1>
            <p>I am a web developer who is competent in both backend and frontend
                technologies. I know how to make the User Experience and User Interface both
                functional and usable by target users. I would also make the site usable to the
                target users. I also have an understanding of the backend from having worked with
                database systems such as PostgreSQL and MySQL and also frameworks such as
                Laravel(PHP) and Rails(Ruby)
